                        This results in a waste of money and resources for organizations looking to advertise. Further,
                        the

                            social media has increased 2-4X in the last ten
                            years. As a result, brands
                            are
                            left with an uncomfortable feeling when social media advertising does not go as planned. The
                            common
                            advertising strategy is to be louder: use flashy design and pay more to be seen more. With
                            the
                            Eq
                            exhibition being so unique, a different approach was necessary.<br><br>

                            Through collaboration with the exhibition curator, a 4-part video series was created: SOMVO,
                            Story
                            of My Very Own. The Eq exhibition poses deep questions regarding moral responsibility and
                            being
                            active in one's spiritual practice. Based on the exhibition’s intent, the video series
                            discusses
                            internal change and transformation. The video series takes us through the first-hand
                            experiences
                            of
                            the main character who, with the help of his friends, is trying to navigate a tough
                            situation.
                            The
                            viewer creates unique associations to the episodes based on their own personal journey.

                        Raj, Mannys friend, reaches out to talk but finds the voicemail on the other side so he explains
                        his thinking. Visually, vast landscapes contrasted with small-scale objects depict a state of
                        loneliness. The sound design provides an element of contemplation.

                        Mannys mental instability is revealed. Visuals of nature provide a space for self-reflection.
                        The sound design creates a space for Manny to open up about what's on his mind.

                        Mannys younger cousin urges him to keep at it. Visuals of buildings and concrete foster the act
                        of building oneself back up while the sound design adds an element of reassurance.

                        foreshadowing a positive space to come to. Visuals demonstrate introspection and the sound
                        design provides a new chance.

                        through shares, comments, and tags. As videos release, the puzzle is pieced together. People are
                        provoked to reflect internally about the videos, which embody the exhibitions messaging.

                        In today's social media landscape, leaving things up to interpretation creates an environment
                        where people don't feel sold to. People are active in viewing, which generates a community of
                        participants. <br><br>

                Born in Prince George, BC, Canada in 1993 & 1995 – Makkan & Mandeep Singh come from two different
                schools of
                thought: direct response marketing & civil engineering. <br> <br>

                It was in London UK, where Maker Brothers apprenticed under industry creatives (Vogue, Adidas, Nike).
                There
                they formed a unique process of creating multimedia communication: distilling a product or service down
                to a
                primary strength. <br><br>

                This notion of primary strength merged with finding the most effective medium and serving a target
                audience
                is what makes their interdisciplinary practice today. <br><br>
